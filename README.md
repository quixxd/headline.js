headline.js HTML Presentation Engine
===========

headline.js is a HTML and Javascript-based Presentation Engine for using in offline and online presentations and pitches.

You can only present headlines. There is no images, no lists, no even slide text. You have one line for slide. It is you what makes your presentations interesting, not your slides.

So: animate your body, and not your slides.
